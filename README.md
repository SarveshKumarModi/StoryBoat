# StoryBoat
The “StoryBoat” is a platform where the story authors and readers put together their ideas and impressions towards others all around the globe. The story writers can write best quality stories which can be interpreted into Augmented Reality/ Virtual Reality or 360° Videos. 


The main aim to design this project was to provide the user an easy and interactive way of reading and writing stories. With the advent of computers as a substitute or rather a replacement for humans, the immersive experience manually maintaining complex processes is simplified.
Only those users who have provided authenticate details are allowed either to register as a user or to process further. Effective management is always a key factor in any form of business. It is no exception. A great deal of technological advancements has led the way to efficient management.
As a consequence of the emergence of newer products, new entities and attributes may have to be incorporated. Our application offers a solution to real life situations to an appreciable extent.
